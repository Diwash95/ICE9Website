                <!-- Analysis content from analysis_report.md -->
                <p>This chart focuses on the inflation index for the last few years, starting from 2018. Since it is a stacked bar chart, the height of each bar shows the **total combined inflation index** of all four regions (US Average, NY, LA, and Chicago) for that year.</p>
                <p>The biggest takeaway here is the overall trend: the total height of the bars gets noticeably larger as you move from 2018 to 2022. This shows that the combined inflation pressure across these major US areas was consistently growing, especially with a visible jump in 2022.</p>
                <p>The colors inside the bar also tell us that New York is consistently the biggest contributor to that yearly total, as its colored section is always the thickest or highest placed segment in the stack.</p>
